# To Eat or Not To Eat: WHERE is the question?
This github repo contains the R script used to implement a Shiny App to vizualize NYC Restaurant Closures. Packages used for the implementation include: shiny, ggplot2, googleVis, plotly, and leaflet. You can check my Shiny application on this link https://yvonnelau.shinyapps.io/nyc-restaurant-closures/

## NYC-Restaurant-Closures-Shiny
According to NYC Health, “Each year, thousands of New York City residents become sick from consuming foods or drinks that are contaminated with harmful bacteria, viruses or parasites”. Since a common source of food poisoning stems from eating out at insalubrious restaurants, this Shiny App focuses on displaying information of restaurants with a track record of poor performance at sanitary inspections. On my app, you will find an interactive map of restaurant closures and data/plots of restaurant closures segmented by Borough and Cuisine.
